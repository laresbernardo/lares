\title{Outliers: Z-score method}
\usage{
outlier_zscore(x, thresh = 3, mad = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric. Distribution}

\item{thresh}{Numeric. Z-Score threshold for n standard deviations.}

\item{mad}{Boolean. Use median absolute deviation instead?}
}
\value{
data.frame. Each row is an \code{x} observation with its 
respective std/mean or mad/med calculations depending on \code{mad} input.
}
\description{
Z-score, also called a standard score, of an observation is a 
distance from the population center measured in number of normalization 
units. The default choice for center is sample mean and for 
normalization unit is standard deviation. Values are considered 
outliers based on z-score if its absolute value of 
default z-score is higher then the threshold (popular choice is 3).
