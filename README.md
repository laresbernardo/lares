# library(lares)

This is my personal library used to automate and fasten my everyday work on **Analysis and Machine Learning** tasks. You are most welcome to install, use, and comment on any of its code and functionalities. Feel free to contact me and/or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laresbernardo/)!

## Getting Started

### Fresh library install
```devtools::install_github("laresbernardo/lares")```

### Update library
```
lares::updateLares() # From Github repository (Bitbucket discontinued)
lares::updateLares(local=T) # Personal and local files, not necessarily deployed
```
Everytime you update the library, I recommend restarting your session: close RStudio and reopen it.
